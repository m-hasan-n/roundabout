# Maneuver-based Anchor Trajectory Hypotheses
We extend existing recurrent encoder-decoder models to be advantageously
combined with anchor trajectories to predict vehicle behaviors
on a roundabout. Driversâ€™ intentions are encoded by a set
of maneuvers that correspond to semantic driving concepts.
Accordingly, our model employs a set of maneuver-specific
anchor trajectories that cover the space of possible outcomes
at the roundabout. The proposed model can output a multi-
modal distribution over the predicted future trajectories based
on the maneuver-specific anchors. We evaluate our model using
the public RounD dataset.

## RounD Dataset Pre-processing
The RounD dataset is a new dataset of naturalistic
road user trajectories recorded at German roundabouts. Download the dataset to a 'data' directory. After downloading the dataset, pre-process it by running the MATLAB script:
```
preprocess_rounD.m
```
This will do the required pre-processing, split the dataset into train, validation and test subsets, and save the subsets into the 'data' directory.

## Model Arguments
The default network arguments are in:
```
model_args.py 
```
You can set the required experiment arguments in this script. For example: 
* args['ip_dim'] selects the input dimensionality (2D or 3D).

* args['use_intention'] and args['use_anchors'] are Boolean variables that choose whether using intention prediction and anchor trajectories or not.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The model structure is coded in 'model.py'. After setting the required experiment arguments, create a 'trained_model' directory to save the trained models.
You can start model training by running:
```
train.py
```

To test a trained model, first create an 'outfiles' directory, then run:
```
evaluate.py
```
which will load and test the trained model defined by the selected model arguments.
